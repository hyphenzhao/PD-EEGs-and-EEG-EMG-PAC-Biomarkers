# PD-EEGs-and-EEG-EMG-PAC-Biomarkers
## Background
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that can affect motor symptoms and cause gait problems.  Non-invasive biomarkers like beta-gamma phase amplitude coupling (PAC) in the motor cortex and muscles hold promise for understanding and managing PD.
## Objectives
This study aims to investigate using cortical and cortico-muscular PAC as biomarkers to monitor symptoms, gait performance and levodopa impact in PD. 
## Methods
Motor cortex EEGs and gastrocnemius EMGs were recorded in 30 PD patients during sitting, standing, and free walking under OFF and ON dopaminergic medication. Spectral features and cross-frequency, as well as brain-muscle PACs were analyzed to assess the effects of levodopa, locomotion, and their correlations with PD symptoms.
## Results
Longer gait cycle intervals and shorter step lengths were observed OFF levodopa, correlating with MDS-UPDRS-III scores. Cortical alpha/low beta-broad gamma and cortico-muscular broad beta-gamma PAC (p<0.05) significantly increased during levodopa withdrawal independent from locomotion status. Cortical broad beta-gamma PAC during sitting and standing, and cortico-muscular broad beta-gamma PAC during walking, positively correlated with MDS-UPDRS-III OFF levodopa (p=0.0302, 0.0203, 0.0035, respectively). Increased low beta (12-15Hz) to gamma cortico-muscular PAC during walking were associated with reduced step length (p=0.0206). Event-related PAC analyses unveiled the increase of cortico-muscular theta/alpha (6.0-11.5Hz)-gamma PAC around heel strike ON medication compared to OFF.
## Conclusions
Elevated cortical alpha/low beta-broad gamma PAC and cortico-muscular broad beta-gamma PAC are associated with Parkinsonian motor impairments, whilst cortico-muscular low beta-gamma PAC is linked explicitly to gait dysfunction. These findings suggest that cortical and cortico-muscular PAC are robust biomarkers of PD symptoms and gait difficulties, and shed new insights in the pathophysiology of gait difficulties in PD.
